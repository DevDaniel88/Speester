## Project Overview

The Autohaus Speedster project includes three custom Gutenberg blocks that enhance your WordPress siteâ€™s functionality and presentation:

- **Hero Stage:** Displays a full-size image with text and a Call to Action (CTA) on top. It is perfect for making a strong visual impact on the homepage or landing pages.
- **Blog Gallery:** Displays the newest three blog posts with a "load more" button if there are additional posts. It offers a dynamic way to showcase your latest content.
- **Car Carousel:** Displays cars with their images, brand names, model names, and prices. You can filter the cars by brand using checkboxes. The car data is sourced from the `car-data.json` file in the root WordPress directory.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- **Localwp:** For setting up the local WordPress development environment.
- **Node:** For managing dependencies and running build scripts.
- **SCSS:** For styling the blocks with advanced CSS features.
- **Git:** For version control and managing the project repository.
- **Slick Slider Library:** For creating responsive carousels in the Car Carousel block.
